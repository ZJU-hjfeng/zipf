###Python keyword usage analysis

An attempt at verifying if [Zipf's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law)(Or any other power law for that matter) holds for programming languages as well.
We tried to verify that for python. The "library" for our "language" is the [flask project] (https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask)
The entire Flask project has 885 python files and close to 19541 python keywords.

Turns out only the first few keywords follow some kind of distribution.
